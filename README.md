# InternalCooldowns
3.4.x InternalCooldowns addon

This addon is a derivative of the old LibInternalCooldowns-1.0 project.

The addon displays the internal cooldown of trinkets on:

- Blizzard's actionbar
- Dominos actionbar
- Bartender4 actionbar
- TrinketMenu addon
- Character Info panel

The addon will be released as final. [I do not give permission](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) to re-upload it on other platforms such as Curseforge.
